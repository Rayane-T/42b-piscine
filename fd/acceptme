I, by choosing to participate in the pool and/or study at 42 Berlin, affirm that I will respect the rules mentioned in the PDFs attached to the project, as well as the moral values they convey. I understand that failure to comply with these rules will normally lead to my exclusion from 42, especially in case of cheating or disrespecting other students, staff or external visitors.
